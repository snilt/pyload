Notes:
======

KDE 4+5:
  Setup Window Rules for the mainwindow and the Captcha dialog:
    Appearance & Fixes -> Focus stealing prevention: [Force] [None]

Mint Xfce:
  Tray icon looks crappy and does not work:
    apt-get remove sni-qt
  Maximized window has no frame which leads to wrong position:
    Settings -> Window Manager Tweaks -> Accessibility
      [OFF] Hide frame of windows when maximized

GNOME 3:
  Install TopIcons Plus (https://github.com/phocean/TopIcons-plus):
    dnf install git make
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/phocean/TopIcons-plus.git
    cd TopIcons-plus
    make install
  Re-login to GNOME
    Activities -> Tweak Tool -> Extensions -> [ON] Topicons plus
