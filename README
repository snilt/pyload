Download
========

From the GitHub website:
  https://github.com/snilt/pyload/archive/qt4gui.zip
Or clone the git repository:
  git clone https://github.com/snilt/pyload.git
  git checkout -b forkreadme origin/forkreadme
  git checkout -b qt4gui origin/qt4gui


Dependencies in addition to the dependencies of pyLoad (https://pyload.net):
============================================================================

Python 2.7 (required for PyQt4)
PyQt4
Python bindings for libnotify
  Install on Debian-based Linux systems: apt-get install python-qt4 python-notify


Recommendations (especially for non-KDE desktops):
==================================================

QtCurve
  Install on Debian-based Linux systems: apt-get install qtcurve
Qt4 configuration tool
  (to select the QtCurve widget style if your desktop environment does not provide such option)
  Install on Debian-based Linux systems: apt-get install qt4-qtconfig
  Then run qtconfig and choose QtCurve widget style


Context-sensitive help
======================

For some parts of the GUI there is context-sensitive help available
  indicated by a question mark button in the window's title bar.
On non-KDE desktops:
  If there is no question mark button shown in the main window title bar (and elsewhere),
    you have to trigger the context-sensitive help from the window's system menu,
    usually by clicking on the icon in the left corner of title bar.
  If the help text is unreadable try set a different qt widget style (Qt4 configuration tool)
    or install QtCurve and set QtCurve widget style
