This is a fork of https://github.com/pyload/pyload
with a reworked Qt4/Qt5 GUI on top of the pyLoad stable branch.

README for pyLoad Client v0.4.20 ; Internal version: 2020-07-25
https://github.com/snilt/pyload/tree/forkreadme

The actual source code is in the qt4gui branch.
https://github.com/snilt/pyload/tree/qt4gui


NOTE: If you update from previous pyLoad Client version 0.4.9
      then you must delete the userplugins directory from your config folder at first.
      Start pyLoad Client, goto the 'Log' tab and write down the value of 'Configuration directory'.
      Stop pyLoad Client, navigate to the 'Configuration directory' and delete the 'userplugins' subdirectory.

General Information
===================

Qt graphical library:
  pyLoad Client supports PyQt4 and PyQt5. PyQt provides Python bindings for Qt. PyQt depends on Qt.
  On some systems Qt4 and Qt5 can be installed side by side.
  Before installing PyQt, you may want to check which, or if any, Qt version is already installed on your system.
  Then install the PyQt version which belongs to an existing Qt installation
  if you want to avoid the installation of another Qt version.
  pyLoad Client detects the installed PyQt version on startup, when PyQt4 and PyQt5
  are both installed then PyQt4 will be used.
  You can force the PyQt version to use by command line options.
  Using PyQt5 on an older Qt4 based Linux/Unix-like desktop might require a bit of extra effort,
  see desktop notifications notes below.

Desktop notifications:
  pyLoad Client uses the Qt library which has built-in support for desktop notifications, it should work seamless.
  However, on Linux/Unix-like OSs, additional packages might provide better desktop integration:
    First option (recommended):
      notify2  ---  Python interface to DBus notifications
        This is a replacement for the older pynotify.
        If your Linux distribution doesn't have a suitable python 2.7 package,
        you may want to install it via pip, see: https://pypi.org/project/notify2
    Second option:
      pynotify  ---  Python bindings for libnotify
        This doesn't work for pyLoad Client on some (modern) systems,
        and can be the reason for pyLoad Client to crash with a segmentation fault on every startup,
        or may just work fine for pyLoad Client (even on modern systems).
        On some systems you possibly also must install:
          'Python bindings for the GTK+ widget set' (python-gtk/pygtk2) to get this working correctly.
    Notes:
      By default pyLoad Client automatically chooses the method to use for displaying desktop notifications
      in the following order: notify2, pynotify, qt_tray
      You can force the desktop notification method by command line options.
      If you want to use pynotify together with PyQt5,
      but pyLoad Client crashes with a segmentation fault on every startup:
        Install 'Qt 5 extra widget styles' (on Debian via: apt-get install qt5-style-plugins)
        and start pyLoad Client like this: QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=gtk2 ./pyLoadGui.py
        If that doesn't help:
          Additionally install and setup the 'Qt5 Configuration Utility' (qt5ct)
          and start pyLoad Client like this: QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct ./pyLoadGui.py

OpenSSL:
  pyOpenSSL can be used to encrypt network traffic between pyLoad Client and an external (or remote) pyLoad server.

How to start the application:
  To start pyLoad Client from a terminal on Linux/Unix-like OSs:
    Try: python2.7 pyLoadGui.py
    Or:  python2 pyLoadGui.py
    Or:  python pyLoadGui.py
    Or:  ./pyLoadGui.py
  To start pyLoad Client from a Command Prompt on Windows:
    Try: C:\Python27\python pyLoadGui.py
    Or:  python pyLoadGui.py
    Or:  pyLoadGui.py
  To start pyLoad (the server):
    Do the same as for pyLoad Client but replace pyLoadGui.py with pyLoadCore.py
    Note: You must first configure the server before you can use it.
          To start the pyLoad Configuration Assistent, run pyLoadCore.py with the option: -s
          For the beginning, you can just accept the default values and set a password.

pyLoad Client connections to a remote pyLoad server:
  If you want to connect to a server that runs the official pyLoad code (https://github.com/pyload/pyload/tree/stable),
  you must replace two files on the server side with the ones from this repository, otherwise errors will occur.
    module/remote/thriftbackend/pyload.thrift
    module/remote/thriftbackend/thriftgen/pyload/ttypes.py
